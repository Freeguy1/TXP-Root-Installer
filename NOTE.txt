TXP-Root is a simplistic shell scirpt that uses ADB to attempt an SU install, giving root level access to Adroid users. Use with CAUTION. Very dangerous. Not tested in ICS or SnapDragon CPUs. All apks can be found, for free, on Google Play. They are only here to ensure that you have the correct binaries and installers. Place this package at the root of your SD-Card. Be careful, and please avoid editting unless youspot errors. Mistakes can brick your device...
